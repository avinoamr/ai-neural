My (flawed) journey into Machine Learning, documented step-by-step

This repo documents my journey into machine learning step-by-step. Coming from
an engineering background, it was challenging for me to fully grasp the
intuition around machine learning works without coding it myself.

This code, and commits, tells the story of how I taught myself machine
learning, but it is __definitely, inarguably, terribly flawed and incorrect__. I
know it before the first commit. It should not be considered a definitive guide,
but just a story.
