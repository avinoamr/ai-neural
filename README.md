This repo documents my step-by-step process of learning machine learning. Coming
from an engineering background, it was challenging for me to fully grasp the
intuition around how the concepts of machine learning works without coding it
myself.

The code presented is evolutionary in the sense that it starts with the simple
logic and over several files builds on to a complete real-life example (although
perhaps a simple one). **NOTE** that the code isn't necessarily perfectly
correct, the comments may be wrong at times and there are some concepts that
were skipped altogether. The point here is to build intuition via pure code,
without relying on any machine learning libraries, and do it in a way that
hopefully will allow my future-self to relearn the specifics as needed.
